                    I started diving into computer science at 13 by making games on Roblox. I learned how servers and clients communicate, protecting user info, and both front-end and 
                    back-end development. Dealing with the platform's limitations taught me to write code more efficiently. I also had to figure out issues like "coding myself 
                    into a corner" before I learned Object-Oriented Programming. These experiences gave me skills that work well in different areas of software development.
